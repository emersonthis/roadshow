WORK. IN. PROGRESS!

A WordPress plugin for traveling professionals to build a client list in advance.

The professional enters a set of place that he or she wants to potentially go and work. Users can click on those places to "vote" for them by submitting an email address to be contacted if/when that trip happens.

## Development
